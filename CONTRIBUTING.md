# Hello!

Thank you for considering to contribute to zli!

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the
developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they
should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and
helping you finalize your pull requests.

BastionZero is a simple to use zero-trust access SaaS for dynamic cloud
environments. BastionZero maintains a RESTful style API that is publicly
available. The zli is an application of the API. There are many ways to
contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation,
submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be
incorporated into zli itself. We are primarily looking for contributions related
to expanding the feature set of the zli and it's robustness to handle all the
different use cases you may want to use it for. 

If you have product suggestions or feature requests, please reach out to
product@bastionero.com. 

To report a BastionZero issue please refer to the [support
page](https://cloud.bastionzero.com/support).

If you find a security vulnerability please refer to
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

Questions to consider when evaluating a security concern:
 - Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access
   to?
 - Can I disable something for other people?
 - Does sensitive information get saved to disk or is accessible by other
   programs?

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:
 - What version of npm and node-js are you using?
 - What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
 - What did you do?
 - What did you expect to see?
 - What did you see instead?

If you have logs or screenshots, please provide them in your issue.
