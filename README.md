# zli

## Bastionzero

Bastionzero is a simple to use zero trust access SaaS for dynamic cloud environments. Bastionzero is the most secure way to lock down remote access to servers, containers, clusters, and VMâ€™s in any cloud, public or private. For more information go to [Bastionzero](https://www.bastionzero.com).

The zli is a cli client for interacting with the Bastionzero SaaS

## Install

BastionZero's command-line interface, the `zli`, is available through package managers (`brew`, `yum`, and `apt`).

The `zli` is compatible with both `x86` and `amd64` platforms.
### Brew
```
brew install bastionzero/tap/zli
```

### Yum

*   Use the `yum-config-manager` to add the BastionZero repo.
    ```
    sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo \
    https://download-yum.bastionzero.com/bastionzero.repo
    ```
    
*   Install the `zli`.
    ```
    sudo yum install -y zli
    ```

### Apt
*   Install the BastionZero public key from the Ubuntu key-server.
    ```
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com\
     --recv-keys E5C358E613982017
    ```

*   For `http` (i.e., on an Ubuntu 14.x machine), add the BastionZero repo with:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository \
    'deb http://download-apt.bastionzero.com/production/apt-repo stable main'
    ```

*   For `https`, add the BastionZero repo with:
    ```
    sudo add-apt-repository \
    'deb https://download-apt.bastionzero.com/production/apt-repo stable main'
    ```

*   Update the `apt` cache.
    ```
    sudo apt update
    ```

*   Install the `zli`.
    ```
    sudo apt install -y zli
    ```

## Developer processes

### Clone and setup

It goes without saying, but the first step is to clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/bastionzero/zli.git
```

The `zli` uses git submodules, thus you will need to clone these as well
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

Finally, you will need to install the required packages
```
npm install
```

### Build and Run

Now that everything is ready you can execute any `zli` command you wish by building and running at the same time
```
npm run start -- <cmd> [args] --flag flagArg
```

We would suggest
```
npm run start -- help
```
Or
```
npm run start -- login
```

To see further building options feel to explore the `package.json` file

### Testing

To run unit tests you can use the following command
```
npm run test
```

System tests can also be run using the following command: 
```
npm run system-test
```

Note the following environment variables will need to be set: 
* `DO_API_KEY`: This is the digital ocean API key that is used to spin up droplets (i.e. targets) that is needed in order to run our tests
* The following vars can be used to run different suites. Setting them to "true" will run the suites: 
    * `API_ENABLED`: Run the API test suite
    * `KUBE_ENABLED`: Run the Kubernetes test suite
    * `SSM_ENABLED`: Run the bzero-ssm-agent test suite
    * `VT_ENABLED`: Runs our virtual target test suite (i.e. bzero agent)

There are also some optional parameters that can be used: 
* `SYSTEM_TEST_TAGS`: Comma separated list of optional tags to tag the digital ocean droplet
* `BZERO_AGENT_BRANCH`: In order to build and bzero agent (VT targets, kube, etc) from source, you will need to specify the bzero agent branch. The bzero repo can be found [here](https://github.com/bastionzero/bzero)
* `BCTL_QUICKSTART_VERSION`: This variable can be used to specify which version of the bctl quickstart helm chart to use

### Run against stage or dev

The following command is hidden from the help menu:

```
npm run start -- <cmd> [args] --configName <prod | stage | dev>
zli --configName <prod | stage | dev>
```

## Release Process

We use [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) to package the node.js application into a single executable that can be run even without node or any npm dependencies are installed. The target executables can be configured in the `package.json` file for different OSs as documented [here](https://github.com/vercel/pkg#targets) but the default is to build mac, and linux executable for the current node.js version and arch. Use `npm run release` to package the app and output executables to a `bin` directory.

### Release Versioning

The executables will be published to the s3 bucket with 2 different path prefixes each time the codebuild job is run:

1. `webshell-cli-release/release/latest/`

2. `webshell-cli-release/release/{version}`

Where {version} is the version that is defined in the `package.json` file. This means older versions are still accessible but the `latest` folder will always overwritten by the codebuild job.

## Installing a release

The latest releases can be found here:

```
Mac:        download-zli.bastionzero.com/release/latest/bin/zli-macos
Linux:      download-zli.bastionzero.com/release/latest/bin/zli-linux
```

### Mac users:

- download the executable
- `chmod +x` the executable
- Run the program once and see a warning from Apple
- Go to `System Preferences > Security & Privacy > General > Allow zli`
- Run the executable again and confirm for Apple

Minor releases generating warnings for users to update their zli. Major releases
will cause all lower major versions to error.

### Linux users:

- download the executable
- `chmod +x` the executable

## Running zli

```
zli help  # auto-gen help menu
```
