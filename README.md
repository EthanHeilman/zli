## Release Process

We use [pkg](https://github.com/vercel/pkg) to package the node.js application into a single executable that can be run even without node or any npm dependencies are installed. The target executables can be configured in the `package.json` file for different OSs as documented [here](https://github.com/vercel/pkg#targets) but the default is to build mac, and linux executable for the current node.js version and arch. Use `npm run release` to package the app and output executables to a `bin` directory.

### Release Versioning

The executables will be published to the s3 bucket with 2 different path prefixes each time the codebuild job is run:

1. `webshell-cli-release/release/latest/`

2. `webshell-cli-release/release/{version}`

Where {version} is the version that is defined in the `package.json` file. This means older versions are still accessible but the `latest` folder will always overwritten by the codebuild job.

## Installing a release

The latest releases can be found here:

```
Mac:        download-zli.bastionzero.com/release/latest/bin/zli-macos
